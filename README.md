## Status
### ‚ö†Ô∏èWIP -- Release TBD‚ö†Ô∏è

## Boss Progress
### Vengefly King
Works pretty well
### Gruz Mother
Works
### False Knight
Works pretty well, need to summon him in without dropping
### Massive (Mega) Moss Charger
"That sword was working!"
"It has been rebroke"
### Hornet 1
Jank has been significantly reduced
Silkspear still might be backwards sometimes i havent looked
### Gorb
All the teleports are hardcoded üòî might fix but it sounds so bad to add hooks to every teleport state
### Dung Defender
Pretty good ig
### Soul Warrior
No balloons :(
### Brooding Malwek
Good, wide boi in gallery
### Oro and Mato
They kind of go underground in the phase 2 transition
### Xero
Everything is also hardcoded in the FSM Actions, but Xero chases you so it's still pretty ok
### Crystal Guardian
No lasers from heaven
### Soul Master
Shockwave and Phase 2 Ê≤°ÊúâÁî®
### Oblobbles (Mega Fat Bees)
Work pretty well
### Mantis Lords/SOB
Wall heights for boomerangs are hardcoded so they will throw them from in the floor; otherwise they're good
Mantis thrones are left out for comedic effect
### Marmu
Pretty good -- needs more testing
### Flukemarm
Doesn't spawn flukes (too much protection i think)
### Broken Vessel
[see similar](#L22)
### Galien
Works pretty well, haven't localized teleport vectors
### Sheo
Works pretty good
### Hive Knight + Elder Hu
TODO
### The Collector
Only tested in first room in the game (big kings pass room) and the fact that theres no ceiling makes him go to the sky. Somehow jars seem to work tho
### God Tamer + TMG + Watcher Knights + Uumuu + Nosk
TODO
### Winged Knosk
Good
### Sly
TODO
### Hornet 2
Need to apply fix on Hornet 1 discussed in notes (floor y loc), also need to use GG hornet instead of Kingdoms Edge and yeet the ConstrainPosition
### Enraged Guardian + Lost Kin + No Eyes + Traitor Lord + White Defender + Soul Tyrant + Markoth + Grey Prince Zote + Failed Champion + NKG + THK + Pure Vessel + The Radiance
TODO
### Abs Rad
I mean it attacks?
Theres no way phases 4 and 5 are gonna be compatible tho lol
Maybe do phases 1-3 (beginning to sword rain) and then skip to phase 6?
